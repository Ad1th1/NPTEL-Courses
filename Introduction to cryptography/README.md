I am in love with cryptography. The mathematics takes some time to sink in, but once it does, I usually feel like I am on top of the frigging moon.

I hope to, through this course actually understand the gorgeousness of the subject in a little more depth than my current pretentious state assumes I know.

Cheers to crypto!
